    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 Anaphylactic ReactionsSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin capsules, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.5.2 Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES)Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with amoxicillin use[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)], with most cases occurring in pediatric patients \u226418 years of age. DIES is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction characterized by protracted vomiting occurring 1 to 4 hours after drug ingestion in the absence of skin or respiratory symptoms. DIES may be associated with pallor, lethargy, hypotension, shock, diarrhea within 24 hours after ingesting amoxicillin, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. If DIES occurs, discontinue amoxicillin and institute appropriate therapy.5.3Clostridium difficileAssociated DiarrheaClostridium difficileassociated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin capsules, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth ofC. difficile.C. difficileproduces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains ofC. difficilecause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed againstC. difficilemay need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment ofC. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant BacteriaPrescribing amoxicillin capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.5.5 Use in Patients With MononucleosisA high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin capsules develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin capsules should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.\n5.1 Anaphylactic ReactionsSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin.

Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment ofC. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant BacteriaPrescribing amoxicillin capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.5.5 Use in Patients With MononucleosisA high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin capsules develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin capsules should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.\n5.1 Anaphylactic ReactionsSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin capsules, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.5.2 Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES)Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with amoxicillin use[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)], with most cases occurring in pediatric patients \u226418 years of age. DIES is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction characterized by protracted vomiting occurring 1 to 4 hours after drug ingestion in the absence of skin or respiratory symptoms. DIES may be associated with pallor, lethargy, hypotension, shock, diarrhea within 24 hours after ingesting amoxicillin, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. If DIES occurs, discontinue amoxicillin and institute appropriate therapy.5.3Clostridium difficileAssociated DiarrheaClostridium difficileassociated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin capsules, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth ofC. difficile.C. difficileproduces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains ofC. difficilecause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed againstC. difficilemay need to be discontinued.

For more information on adverse reactions with clarithromycin or lansoprazole, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their package inserts.6.2 Postmarketing or Other ExperienceIn addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of penicillins. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin capsules.Infections and Infestations:Mucocutaneous candidiasis.Gastrointestinal:Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES), black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis.

    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS": "7.1 ProbenecidProbenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin capsules. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.7.2 Oral AnticoagulantsAbnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.7.3 AllopurinolThe concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.7.4 Oral ContraceptivesAmoxicillin capsules may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.7.5 Other AntibacterialsChloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstratedin vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.7.6 Effects on Laboratory TestsHigh urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST\u00ae, Benedict\u2019s Solution, or Fehling\u2019s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX\u00ae) be used.Following administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.\n7.1 ProbenecidProbenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin capsules.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyReproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.8.2 Labor and DeliveryOral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.8.3 Nursing MothersPenicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.8.4 Pediatric UseBecause of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of amoxicillin capsules should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (\u2264 3 months).[see Dosage and Administration (2.2).]8.5 Geriatric UseAn analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin capsules was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.8.6 Dosing in Renal ImpairmentAmoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min).

Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.8.6 Dosing in Renal ImpairmentAmoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min). See Dosing in Renal Impairment (2.4) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.\n8.1 PregnancyReproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.8.2 Labor and DeliveryOral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.8.3 Nursing MothersPenicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.8.4 Pediatric UseBecause of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionAmoxicillin is an antibacterial drug.[see Microbiology (12.4)].12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorption:Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg amoxicillin result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.Distribution:Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein-bound. Following a 1 gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid.Metabolism and Excretion:The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].12.4 MicrobiologyMechanism of ActionAmoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.Mechanism of ResistanceResistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the bacteria listed below, bothin vitroand in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.Gram-Positive BacteriaEnterococcus faecalisStaphylococcusspp.Streptococcus pneumoniaeStreptococcusspp. (alpha and beta-hemolytic)Gram-Negative BacteriaEscherichia coliHaemophilus influenzaeHelicobacter pyloriProteus mirabilisSusceptibility TestingFor specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionAmoxicillin is an antibacterial drug.[see Microbiology (12.4)].12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorption:Amoxicillin is stable in the presence of gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.Orally administered doses of 250 mg and 500 mg amoxicillin result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.Distribution:Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed.

When amoxicillin capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.Patients should be counseled that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, and it usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.Patients should be aware that amoxicillin capsules contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.The brands listed are trademarks of their respective owners and are not trademarks of Micro Labs.
