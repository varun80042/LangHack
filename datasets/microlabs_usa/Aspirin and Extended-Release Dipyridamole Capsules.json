    "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS": "5.1 Risk of BleedingAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [seeDrug Interactions (7.1)].Intracranial HemorrhageIn European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups.Gastrointestinal (GI) Side EffectsGI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur.In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups.Peptic Ulcer DiseaseAvoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding.Alcohol WarningBecause aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.5.2 Renal FailureAvoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)].5.3 Hepatic InsufficiencyElevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations(8.6)and Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)].5.4 Coronary Artery DiseaseDipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole.For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications.5.5 HypotensionDipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension.5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic AgentsClinical \n         experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing[seeDrug Interactions (7.1)].Intake \n         of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test.5.7 GeneralAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.\n5.1 Risk of BleedingAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding.

ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [seeClinical Studies (14)]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes.This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone.

    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS": "7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From LiteratureAdenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A2A-receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing.Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) InhibitorsBecause of the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin.AcetazolamideConcurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.Anticoagulants and AntiplateletsPatients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk.AnagrelidePatients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding.AnticonvulsantsSalicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.Beta BlockersThe hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention.Cholinesterase InhibitorsDipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.DiureticsThe effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention.MethotrexateSalicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired.Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function.Oral HypoglycemicsModerate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia.Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone)Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents.\n7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From LiteratureAdenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine.

    "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS": "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAvailable data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes(see Data).Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole(see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsLabor and DeliveryAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin, increases the risk for bleeding[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].Maternal use of high-dose aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery, prolonged gestation, prolonged labor, intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, low birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal death.DataHuman DataPublished data from clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified a clear association between aspirin\u00ad dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies.Animal DataAspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively.\u00a0 These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole.\u00a0 Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryBased on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels(see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for\u00a0 aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules\u00a0 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from \u00a0aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules\u00a0 or from the underlying maternal condition.DataA published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted.8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied.

Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies.Animal DataAspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively.\u00a0 These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole.\u00a0 Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1\u00bd, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryBased on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels(see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for\u00a0 aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules\u00a0 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from \u00a0aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules\u00a0 or from the underlying maternal condition.DataA published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted.8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of\u00a0 the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [see Contraindications(4.3)].8.5 Geriatric UseOf the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)].8.6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal DysfunctionAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min) dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions(5.2,5.3)and Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)].\n8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryAvailable data from published studies and postmarketing experience with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes(see Data).Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole(see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

    "10 OVERDOSAGE": "Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above \u00a0400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the\u00a0 vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.\nBecause of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose.

A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the\u00a0 vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.\nBecause of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL.

    "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin.DipyridamoleDipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytesin vitroandin vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A2-receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u00adguanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide).AspirinAspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2, a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.12.2 PharmacodynamicsThe effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated.12.3 PharmacokineticsThere are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. \u00a0The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.AbsorptionDipyridamole:Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). \u00a0The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL).Aspirin:Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). \u00a0The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). \u00a0Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin.Effect of FoodDipyridamole:When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (Cmax) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant.Aspirin:When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in Cmaxwas not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state.DistributionDipyridamole:Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. \u00a0Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin.Aspirin:Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). \u00a0Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL[seeOverdosage (10)].Metabolism and EliminationDipyridamole:Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of\u00a0\u00a0 about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbzwith a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours.Aspirin:Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing\u00a0 and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours.\u00a0 Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose[seeOverdosage (10)]. \u00a0Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.Specific PopulationsGeriatric Patients:Dipyridamole:In ESPS2[seeClinical Studies (14)], plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.Hepatic Dysfunction:No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction.Dipyridamole:In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure.Aspirin:Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.Renal Dysfunction:Dipyridamole:In ESPS2 patients[seeClinical Studies (14)], with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age.Aspirin:Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min).Drug Interaction StudiesA dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (Cmaxand AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin.DipyridamoleDipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytesin vitroandin vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL).

Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose[seeOverdosage (10)]. \u00a0Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.Specific PopulationsGeriatric Patients:Dipyridamole:In ESPS2[seeClinical Studies (14)], plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.Hepatic Dysfunction:No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction.Dipyridamole:In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure.Aspirin:Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.Renal Dysfunction:Dipyridamole:In ESPS2 patients[seeClinical Studies (14)], with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age.Aspirin:Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min).Drug Interaction StudiesA dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (Cmaxand AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state.\n12.1 Mechanism of ActionThe antithrombotic action of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin.DipyridamoleDipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytesin vitroandin vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5 to 1.9 mcg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A2-receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'\u00adguanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide).AspirinAspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2, a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.12.2 PharmacodynamicsThe effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated.12.3 PharmacokineticsThere are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole. \u00a0The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co-administration as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.AbsorptionDipyridamole:Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 200 mg BID). \u00a0The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL).Aspirin:Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules (given as 25 mg BID). \u00a0The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 319 ng/mL (175 to 463 ng/mL). \u00a0Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin.Effect of FoodDipyridamole:When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (Cmax) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant.Aspirin:When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in Cmaxwas not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state.DistributionDipyridamole:Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. \u00a0Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin.Aspirin:Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). \u00a0Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL[seeOverdosage (10)].Metabolism and EliminationDipyridamole:Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of\u00a0\u00a0 about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbzwith a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours.Aspirin:Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing\u00a0 and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours.\u00a0 Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%.

Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant.Aspirin:When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in Cmaxwas not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state.DistributionDipyridamole:Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. \u00a0Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin.Aspirin:Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). \u00a0Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL[seeOverdosage (10)].Metabolism and EliminationDipyridamole:Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of\u00a0\u00a0 about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase \u03bbzwith a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules which was 13.6 hours.Aspirin:Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing\u00a0 and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours.\u00a0 Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose[seeOverdosage (10)]. \u00a0Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.Specific PopulationsGeriatric Patients:Dipyridamole:In ESPS2[seeClinical Studies (14)], plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules.Hepatic Dysfunction:No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in patients with hepatic dysfunction.Dipyridamole:In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure.Aspirin:Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.Renal Dysfunction:Dipyridamole:In ESPS2 patients[seeClinical Studies (14)], with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL/min to >100 mL/min, no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age.Aspirin:Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min).Drug Interaction StudiesA dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (Cmaxand AUC) at steady-state were similar with or without omeprazole co-administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation was similar between the treatment arms at steady-state.",

Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo.

These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients.\nESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events.Stroke EndpointAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3).

These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients.\nESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events.Stroke EndpointAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3).

These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients.\nESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events.Stroke EndpointAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3).

These incidence rates for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients.\nESPS2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke (76%) or transient ischemic attack (TIA, 24%) within three months prior to entry. Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups: aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole 25 mg/200 mg; extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) 200 mg alone; aspirin (ASA) 25 mg alone; or placebo. The mean age in this population was 66.7 years with 58% of them being males. Patients received one capsule twice daily (morning and evening). Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death (from all causes) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group. There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender; patients who were older had a trend towards more events.Stroke EndpointAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared to aspirin 50 mg/day alone (p = 0.008) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24.4% compared to extended-release dipyridamole 400 mg/day alone (p = 0.002) (Table 3).
