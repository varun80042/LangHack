    "ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY:": "Effects on ReproductionReproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily (2.4, 4.8 and 19.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area), and bred through one or two matings showed no congenital anomalies, nor were there adverse effects on growth of the newborn. However, in another study at 100 mg/kg daily there was noted a significant decrease in the fertilization rate and a marked decrease in the viability and body weight of offspring which may be attributable to sedative activity, thus resulting in lack of interest in mating and lessened maternal nursing and care of the young. One neonate in each of the first and second matings in the rat reproduction study at the 100 mg/kg dose (24.2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area) exhibited major skeletal defects.Two series of reproduction experiments with clidinium bromide were carried out in rats, employing dosages of 2.5 and 10 mg/kg daily (1.2 and 4.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 20 mg/day, based on body surface area) in each experiment. In the first experiment, clidinium bromide was administered for a 9-week interval prior to mating; no untoward effect on fertilization or gestation was noted. The offspring were taken by caesarean section and did not show a significant incidence of congenital anomalies when compared to control animals. In the second experiment, adult animals were given clidinium bromide for 10 days prior to and through two mating cycles. No significant effects were observed on fertility, gestation, viability of offspring or lactation, as compared to control animals, nor was there a significant incidence of congenital anomalies in the offspring derived from these experiments.A reproduction study was carried out in rats through two successive matings with administration of oral daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and 1.25 mg/kg clidinium bromide (0.6 times the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area) or 25 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and 12.5 mg/kg clidinium bromide (6.1 times the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area). In the first mating, no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups, with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the high dosage. In the second mating, similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning. No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups.\nEffects on ReproductionReproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily (2.4, 4.8 and 19.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area), and bred through one or two matings showed no congenital anomalies, nor were there adverse effects on growth of the newborn.

    "WARNINGS:": "Risks From Concomitant Use with OpioidsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs - in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule is used with opioids (seePRECAUTIONS).Abuse, Misuse, and AddictionThe use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Before prescribing chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.Dependence and Withdrawal ReactionsTo reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dosage) (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.Acute Withdrawal ReactionsThe continued use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Protracted Withdrawal SyndromeIn some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate MachineryAs in the case of other preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules should be cautioned about possible combined effects with opioids, alcohol and other CNS depressants. For the same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeUse of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (seePRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.\nRisks From Concomitant Use with OpioidsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.

Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.Dependence and Withdrawal ReactionsTo reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dosage) (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.Acute Withdrawal ReactionsThe continued use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Protracted Withdrawal SyndromeIn some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate MachineryAs in the case of other preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules should be cautioned about possible combined effects with opioids, alcohol and other CNS depressants. For the same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeUse of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (seePRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.\nRisks From Concomitant Use with OpioidsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs - in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule is used with opioids (seePRECAUTIONS).Abuse, Misuse, and AddictionThe use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death.

If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.Dependence and Withdrawal ReactionsTo reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dosage) (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.Acute Withdrawal ReactionsThe continued use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Protracted Withdrawal SyndromeIn some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate MachineryAs in the case of other preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules should be cautioned about possible combined effects with opioids, alcohol and other CNS depressants. For the same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeUse of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (seePRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.\nRisks From Concomitant Use with OpioidsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs - in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule is used with opioids (seePRECAUTIONS).Abuse, Misuse, and AddictionThe use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Before prescribing chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool).

Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Protracted Withdrawal SyndromeIn some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Effects on the Ability to Drive or Operate MachineryAs in the case of other preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules should be cautioned about possible combined effects with opioids, alcohol and other CNS depressants. For the same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeUse of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (seePRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.\nRisks From Concomitant Use with OpioidsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs - in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule is used with opioids (seePRECAUTIONS).Abuse, Misuse, and AddictionThe use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Before prescribing chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

For the same reason, they should be cautioned against hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeUse of benzodiazepines late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (seePRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly.\nRisks From Concomitant Use with OpioidsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs - in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule is used with opioids (seePRECAUTIONS).Abuse, Misuse, and AddictionThe use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (seeDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Before prescribing chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug.

    "PRECAUTIONS:": "CNS Adverse ReactionsIn geriatric or debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion (not more than 2 chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules per day initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). In general, the concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed \u2014 particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, e.g., excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary.Information for PatientsAbuse, Misuse, and AddictionInform patients that the use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances.Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (seeWARNINGS).Withdrawal ReactionsInform patients that the continued use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may require a slow taper (seeWARNINGSandDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Concomitant Use with Opioids and Other CNS DepressantsInform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0are used with opioids or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions).PregnancyAdvise pregnant females that use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and /or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome andPRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant.NursingInstruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed (seePRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).Drug InteractionsOpioidsThe concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration.Benzodiazepines interact at GABAAsites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.Oral AnticoagulantsAlthough clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules.PregnancyRisk SummaryChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideNeonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeandPRECAUTIONS,Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects(see Data).Clidinium BromideOver decades of use, there is an absence of published data on orally administered clidinium bromide in pregnant women, including an absence of any reports of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsFetal/Neonatal Adverse ReactionsBenzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).DataHuman DataPublished data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol. Tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.Animal DataOral daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 1.25 mg/kg clidinium bromide or 25 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 12.5 mg/kg clidinium bromide (0.6 and 6.1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area) were administered to rats in a reproduction study through two successive matings. In the first mating, no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups, with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the highest dosage. In the second mating, similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning. No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups.Nursing MothersChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideThere are no data on the presence of chlordiazepoxide in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, there are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to other benzodiazepines through breast milk.Reproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily (2.4, 4.8 and 19.4 times respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area), and bred through one or two matings showed no adverse effects on lactation of the dams.Clidinium BromideThere are no data on the presence of clidinium in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As with other anticholinergic drugs, clidinium may cause suppression of lactation.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. Infants exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseGeriatric subjects may be particularly prone to experiencing drowsiness, ataxia and confusion while receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. These effects can usually be avoided with proper dosage adjustment, although they have occasionally been observed even at the lower dosage ranges. Dosing in geriatric subjects should be initiated cautiously (no more than 2 capsules per day) and increased gradually if needed and tolerated (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules is contraindicated in the presence of glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy and benign bladder neck obstruction (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\nCNS Adverse ReactionsIn geriatric or debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion (not more than 2 chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules per day initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated).

Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant.NursingInstruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed (seePRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).Drug InteractionsOpioidsThe concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration.Benzodiazepines interact at GABAAsites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.Oral AnticoagulantsAlthough clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules.PregnancyRisk SummaryChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideNeonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeandPRECAUTIONS,Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects(see Data).Clidinium BromideOver decades of use, there is an absence of published data on orally administered clidinium bromide in pregnant women, including an absence of any reports of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsFetal/Neonatal Adverse ReactionsBenzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).DataHuman DataPublished data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol. Tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.Animal DataOral daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 1.25 mg/kg clidinium bromide or 25 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 12.5 mg/kg clidinium bromide (0.6 and 6.1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area) were administered to rats in a reproduction study through two successive matings. In the first mating, no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups, with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the highest dosage. In the second mating, similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning. No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups.Nursing MothersChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideThere are no data on the presence of chlordiazepoxide in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, there are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to other benzodiazepines through breast milk.Reproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily (2.4, 4.8 and 19.4 times respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area), and bred through one or two matings showed no adverse effects on lactation of the dams.Clidinium BromideThere are no data on the presence of clidinium in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As with other anticholinergic drugs, clidinium may cause suppression of lactation.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. Infants exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseGeriatric subjects may be particularly prone to experiencing drowsiness, ataxia and confusion while receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. These effects can usually be avoided with proper dosage adjustment, although they have occasionally been observed even at the lower dosage ranges. Dosing in geriatric subjects should be initiated cautiously (no more than 2 capsules per day) and increased gradually if needed and tolerated (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules is contraindicated in the presence of glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy and benign bladder neck obstruction (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\nCNS Adverse ReactionsIn geriatric or debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion (not more than 2 chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules per day initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). In general, the concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed \u2014 particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, e.g., excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary.Information for PatientsAbuse, Misuse, and AddictionInform patients that the use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances.Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (seeWARNINGS).Withdrawal ReactionsInform patients that the continued use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months.

The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary.Information for PatientsAbuse, Misuse, and AddictionInform patients that the use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances.Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (seeWARNINGS).Withdrawal ReactionsInform patients that the continued use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may require a slow taper (seeWARNINGSandDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Concomitant Use with Opioids and Other CNS DepressantsInform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0are used with opioids or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions).PregnancyAdvise pregnant females that use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and /or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome andPRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant.NursingInstruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed (seePRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).Drug InteractionsOpioidsThe concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration.Benzodiazepines interact at GABAAsites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.Oral AnticoagulantsAlthough clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules.PregnancyRisk SummaryChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideNeonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeandPRECAUTIONS,Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects(see Data).Clidinium BromideOver decades of use, there is an absence of published data on orally administered clidinium bromide in pregnant women, including an absence of any reports of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsFetal/Neonatal Adverse ReactionsBenzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).DataHuman DataPublished data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol. Tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.Animal DataOral daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 1.25 mg/kg clidinium bromide or 25 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 12.5 mg/kg clidinium bromide (0.6 and 6.1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area) were administered to rats in a reproduction study through two successive matings. In the first mating, no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups, with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the highest dosage. In the second mating, similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning. No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups.Nursing MothersChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideThere are no data on the presence of chlordiazepoxide in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, there are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to other benzodiazepines through breast milk.Reproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily (2.4, 4.8 and 19.4 times respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area), and bred through one or two matings showed no adverse effects on lactation of the dams.Clidinium BromideThere are no data on the presence of clidinium in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As with other anticholinergic drugs, clidinium may cause suppression of lactation.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. Infants exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseGeriatric subjects may be particularly prone to experiencing drowsiness, ataxia and confusion while receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. These effects can usually be avoided with proper dosage adjustment, although they have occasionally been observed even at the lower dosage ranges. Dosing in geriatric subjects should be initiated cautiously (no more than 2 capsules per day) and increased gradually if needed and tolerated (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules is contraindicated in the presence of glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy and benign bladder neck obstruction (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\nCNS Adverse ReactionsIn geriatric or debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion (not more than 2 chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules per day initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). In general, the concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed \u2014 particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used.

In general, the concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed \u2014 particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, e.g., excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary.Information for PatientsAbuse, Misuse, and AddictionInform patients that the use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances.Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (seeWARNINGS).Withdrawal ReactionsInform patients that the continued use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules may require a slow taper (seeWARNINGSandDRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).Concomitant Use with Opioids and Other CNS DepressantsInform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0are used with opioids or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (seeWARNINGSandPRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions).PregnancyAdvise pregnant females that use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and /or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome andPRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant.NursingInstruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed (seePRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).Drug InteractionsOpioidsThe concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration.Benzodiazepines interact at GABAAsites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.Oral AnticoagulantsAlthough clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules.PregnancyRisk SummaryChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideNeonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal SyndromeandPRECAUTIONS,Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects(see Data).Clidinium BromideOver decades of use, there is an absence of published data on orally administered clidinium bromide in pregnant women, including an absence of any reports of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsFetal/Neonatal Adverse ReactionsBenzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride), during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (seeWARNINGS, Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).DataHuman DataPublished data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol. Tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.Animal DataOral daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 1.25 mg/kg clidinium bromide or 25 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride with 12.5 mg/kg clidinium bromide (0.6 and 6.1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose for both drugs, based on body surface area) were administered to rats in a reproduction study through two successive matings. In the first mating, no significant differences were noted between the control or the treated groups, with the exception of a slight decrease in the number of animals surviving during lactation among those receiving the highest dosage. In the second mating, similar results were obtained except for a slight decrease in the number of pregnant females and in the percentage of offspring surviving until weaning. No congenital anomalies were observed in both matings in either the control or treated groups.Nursing MothersChlordiazepoxide HydrochlorideThere are no data on the presence of chlordiazepoxide in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, there are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to other benzodiazepines through breast milk.Reproduction studies in rats fed chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, 10, 20 and 80 mg/kg daily (2.4, 4.8 and 19.4 times respectively, the maximum recommended clinical dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area), and bred through one or two matings showed no adverse effects on lactation of the dams.Clidinium BromideThere are no data on the presence of clidinium in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As with other anticholinergic drugs, clidinium may cause suppression of lactation.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. Infants exposed to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseGeriatric subjects may be particularly prone to experiencing drowsiness, ataxia and confusion while receiving chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules. These effects can usually be avoided with proper dosage adjustment, although they have occasionally been observed even at the lower dosage ranges. Dosing in geriatric subjects should be initiated cautiously (no more than 2 capsules per day) and increased gradually if needed and tolerated (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

    "DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:": "Controlled SubstanceChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule contains chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a Schedule IV controlled substance and clidinium bromide, which is not a controlled substance. Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule\u00a0is exempted from Schedule IV and is not controlled under the Controlled Substances Act.AbuseChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, is a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders (seeWARNINGS).The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).DependencePhysicalDependenceChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use (seeWARNINGS).To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0or reduce the dosage (seeWARNINGSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Acute Withdrawal Signs and SymptomsAcute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures and suicidality.ProtractedWithdrawalSyndromeProtracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.ToleranceTolerance to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effects of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.\nControlled SubstanceChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule contains chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a Schedule IV controlled substance and clidinium bromide, which is not a controlled substance.

More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures and suicidality.ProtractedWithdrawalSyndromeProtracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.ToleranceTolerance to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effects of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.\nControlled SubstanceChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule contains chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a Schedule IV controlled substance and clidinium bromide, which is not a controlled substance. Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsule\u00a0is exempted from Schedule IV and is not controlled under the Controlled Substances Act.AbuseChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, a component of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, is a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders (seeWARNINGS).The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).DependencePhysicalDependenceChlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use (seeWARNINGS).To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules\u00a0or reduce the dosage (seeWARNINGSandDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Acute Withdrawal Signs and SymptomsAcute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor.

    "OVERDOSAGE:": "Overdosage of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride) and an anticholinergic (clidinium bromide) may manifest signs and symptoms related to either of its components, although some effects such as altered levels of consciousness may be synergistic.Overdosage of benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma.Signs and symptoms of anticholinergic overdosage are related to excessive anti-muscarinic anticholinergic activity. Peripheral signs and symptoms may include dry mucous membranes and skin, flushing, tachycardia, hypertension, ileus, urinary retention, and mydriasis. Garbled speech is often pathognomonic. Central signs and symptoms may include agitation and delirium, seizures, and hyperthermia. Benzodiazepines are considered a first-line treatment for anticholinergic toxicity acting to treat mild to moderate agitation and prevent seizures.Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (seeWARNINGS, Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. Anticholinergic drugs usually increase heart rate and blood pressure. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids, and airway management.Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage. Use of flumazenil may increase the risk of seizures in mixed overdosage with drugs that may precipitate seizures, including anticholinergic medications. Benzodiazepines are used to treat agitated delirium from anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, flumazenil administration may worsen the anticholinergic delirium and should generally be avoided.Anticholinesterase inhibitors may reverse severe agitated delirium that is not controlled by benzodiazepines. They may also improve the airway and breathing in CNS depressed patients.

Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma.Signs and symptoms of anticholinergic overdosage are related to excessive anti-muscarinic anticholinergic activity. Peripheral signs and symptoms may include dry mucous membranes and skin, flushing, tachycardia, hypertension, ileus, urinary retention, and mydriasis. Garbled speech is often pathognomonic. Central signs and symptoms may include agitation and delirium, seizures, and hyperthermia. Benzodiazepines are considered a first-line treatment for anticholinergic toxicity acting to treat mild to moderate agitation and prevent seizures.Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (seeWARNINGS, Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. Anticholinergic drugs usually increase heart rate and blood pressure. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids, and airway management.Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage. Use of flumazenil may increase the risk of seizures in mixed overdosage with drugs that may precipitate seizures, including anticholinergic medications. Benzodiazepines are used to treat agitated delirium from anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, flumazenil administration may worsen the anticholinergic delirium and should generally be avoided.Anticholinesterase inhibitors may reverse severe agitated delirium that is not controlled by benzodiazepines. They may also improve the airway and breathing in CNS depressed patients.
