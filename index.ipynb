Its chemical name is N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP). It is a white, crystalline powder with a melting point of 154-156°C.\\n\\n**Primary Use:**\\nThe primary use of Paracetamol is for the relief of mild to moderate pain, such as headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis pain, toothache, and pain caused by cold, flu, sprains, and dysmenorrhea. It is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO).\\n\\n**Mechanism of Action:**\\nThe exact mechanism of action of Paracetamol is unclear, but it is believed to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, similar to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This activity leads to the reduction of prostaglandins in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in its analgesic and antipyretic effects.\\n\\n**Availability and Dosage Forms:**\\nParacetamol is available in various forms, including syrup, tablets, and capsules. It can be administered orally, rectally, or intravenously (IV).\\n\\n**Important Safety Information:**\\nExcessive use of Paracetamol can damage multiple organs, especially the liver and kidney. The toxicity is due to its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). Acetylcysteine (NAC) is used as an antidote to help neutralize NAPQI and prevent liver damage.\\n\\n**Interactions:**\\nParacetamol can interact with other medications, such as prokinetic agents like metoclopramide, which can increase the risk of asthma and developmental and reproductive disorders in offspring.\\n\\n**Pregnancy and Children:**\\nParacetamol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. However, the evidence for this association is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the risks.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nIn summary, Paracetamol is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent for the relief of mild to moderate pain. Its exact mechanism of action is unclear, but it is believed to inhibit the COX pathways. While it has several benefits, excessive use can lead to liver and kidney damage. It is essential to follow the recommended dosage and usage guidelines, especially in pregnant women and children.\\n\\nMore research is needed to fully understand the effects of Paracetamol on musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis and backache. Additionally, the benefits of Paracetamol in treating chronic pain are uncertain.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.'}], 'context': ['URL: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/acetaminophen\\nContent: Acetaminophen (paracetamol), also commonly known as Tylenol, is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO).It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever.

Administration\\nAvailable Dosage Forms\\nAcetaminophen can be administered through oral, rectal, or IV routes.[10]\\nTompkins et al conducted a literature review on the effectiveness of IV acetaminophen in postoperative pain control.[11]\\xa0The investigators found a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of IV acetaminophen when compared to oral or rectal acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, or placebo across various surgical procedures, including abdominal, gynecological, genitourinary, orthopedic, neurosurgical, cardiac, and renal surgeries. There is also a theoretical proposition that acetaminophen inhibits a splice variant of COX-1, referred to as COX-3, although this hypothesis has not been verified in humans.[5]\\nRegardless, the reduction of the COX pathway activity by acetaminophen is thought to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins in the CNS, leading to its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Pregnant women are advised to exercise caution when using acetaminophen early in pregnancy due to emerging evidence suggesting that in-utero exposure to acetaminophen may elevate the risk of neurological, reproductive, and urogenital disorders in the fetus.[12] A study by Alemany et al investigated prenatal and postnatal acetaminophen exposure in relation to Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) and ADHD.[21]\\xa0Acetaminophen exposure was assessed in 73,881 mother-child pairs through questionnaires or interviews.', 'URL: https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/paracetamol\\nContent: Know about technical details of Paracetamol like: chemical name, chemistry structure, formulation, uses, toxicity, action, side effects and more at Pharmacompass.com. Technical details about Paracetamol, learn more about the structure, uses, toxicity, action, side effects and more', 'URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol\\nContent: It appears that 0.2\\xa0°C decrease of the body temperature in children after a standard dose of paracetamol is of questionable value, particularly in emergency situations.[14] Based on this, some physicians advocate using higher doses that may decrease the temperature by as much as 0.7\\xa0°C.[17] Meta-analyses showed that paracetamol is less effective than ibuprofen in children (marginally less effective, according to another analysis[62]), including children younger than 2 years old,[63] with equivalent safety.[18] Exacerbation of asthma occurs with similar frequency for both medications.[64] Giving paracetamol and ibuprofen together at the same time to children under 5 is not recommended, however doses may be alternated if required.[60]\\nPain[edit]\\nParacetamol is used for the relief of mild to moderate pain such as headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis pain, toothache as well as pain caused by cold, flu, sprains, and dysmenorrhea.[65] It is recommended, in particular, for acute mild to moderate pain, since the evidence for the treatment of chronic pain is insufficient.[15]\\nThe benefits of paracetamol in musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis and backache, are uncertain.[15]\\nIt appears to provide only small and not clinically important benefits in osteoarthritis.[15][27] While the antidote, acetylcysteine (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver; a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe.[42][110]\\nNAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without), but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice.[111][112] Toxicity of paracetamol is due to its quinone metabolite NAPQI and NAC also helps in neutralizing it.[109] Kidney failure is also a possible side effect.[106]\\nInteractions[edit]\\nProkinetic agents such as metoclopramide accelerate gastric emptying, shorten time (tmax) to paracetamol peak blood plasma concentration (Cmax), and increase Cmax. However, indications exist of a possible increase of asthma and developmental and reproductive disorders in the offspring of women with prolonged use of paracetamol during pregnancy.[86]\\nParacetamol use by the mother during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma,[91][92] but so are the maternal infections for which paracetamol may be used, and separating these influences is difficult.[86] Paracetamol, in a small scale meta-analysis was also associated with 20–30% increase in autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hyperactivity symptoms, and conduct disorder, with the association being lower in a meta-analysis where a larger demographic was used, but it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship and there was potential bias in the findings.[86][93][94] \"[160]\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic it was considered by some in the scientific community that it was an effective analgesic medication to treat symptoms of COVID-19, but this was found to be unsubstantiated.[161][162][163][164]\\nSociety and culture[edit]\\nNaming[edit]\\nParacetamol is the Australian Approved Name[165] and British Approved Name[166] as well as the international nonproprietary name used by the WHO and in many other countries; acetaminophen is the United States Adopted Name[166] and Japanese Accepted Name and also the name generally used in Canada,[166] Venezuela, Colombia, and Iran.[166][167] Both paracetamol and acetaminophen are contractions of para-acetylaminophenol, a chemical name for the compound. Additionally, 4-nitrophenol can be selectively reduced by Tin(II) Chloride in absolute ethanol or ethyl acetate to produce a 91% yield of 4-aminophenol.[129][130][131]\\nAn alternative industrial synthesis developed at Celanese involves firstly direct acylation of phenol with acetic anhydride in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to a ketone, then the conversion of the ketone\\nwith hydroxylamine to a ketoxime, and finally the acid-catalyzed Beckmann rearrangement of the cetoxime to the para-acetylaminophenol product.[129][132]\\nReactions[edit]\\n4-Aminophenol may be obtained by the amide hydrolysis of paracetamol.'], 'result': 'Based on the provided context, I can provide a detailed and accurate response regarding the composition and primary use of Paracetamol.\\n\\n**Composition:**\\nParacetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic agent. Its chemical name is N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP). It is a white, crystalline powder with a melting point of 154-156°C.\\n\\n**Primary Use:**\\nThe primary use of Paracetamol is for the relief of mild to moderate pain, such as headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis pain, toothache, and pain caused by cold, flu, sprains, and dysmenorrhea. It is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO).\\n\\n**Mechanism of Action:**\\nThe exact mechanism of action of Paracetamol is unclear, but it is believed to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, similar to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This activity leads to the reduction of prostaglandins in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in its analgesic and antipyretic effects.\\n\\n**Availability and Dosage Forms:**\\nParacetamol is available in various forms, including syrup, tablets, and capsules. It can be administered orally, rectally, or intravenously (IV).\\n\\n**Important Safety Information:**\\nExcessive use of Paracetamol can damage multiple organs, especially the liver and kidney. The toxicity is due to its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). Acetylcysteine (NAC) is used as an antidote to help neutralize NAPQI and prevent liver damage.\\n\\n**Interactions:**\\nParacetamol can interact with other medications, such as prokinetic agents like metoclopramide, which can increase the risk of asthma and developmental and reproductive disorders in offspring.\\n\\n**Pregnancy and Children:**\\nParacetamol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. However, the evidence for this association is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand the risks.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nIn summary, Paracetamol is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent for the relief of mild to moderate pain. Its exact mechanism of action is unclear, but it is believed to inhibit the COX pathways. While it has several benefits, excessive use can lead to liver and kidney damage. It is essential to follow the recommended dosage and usage guidelines, especially in pregnant women and children.\\n\\nMore research is needed to fully understand the effects of Paracetamol on musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis and backache. Additionally, the benefits of Paracetamol in treating chronic pain are uncertain.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.'}\n",
